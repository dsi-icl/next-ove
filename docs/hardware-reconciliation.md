# Hardware Reconciliation

## Overview

### Purpose:

The Hardware Reconciliation feature ensures that the state of all connected
hardware devices remains synchronized with their expected state. This is crucial
in scenarios where certain devices might fail to execute commands. The feature
operates in the background, continually checking and reconciling the actual
state of the hardware with the expected state, ensuring consistency across the
system.

### Problem Solved:

This feature addresses the issue of hardware desynchronization due to device
failures or missed commands. By automatically reconciling the hardware state
with the expected state, it ensures that devices remain in sync with user
expectations, improving the reliability and stability of the hardware control
system.

## Technical Details

### Main Components:

1. Setup Code:
    - Responsible for initializing the background task that manages the
      reconciliation process.
    - Configures and schedules the task at specified intervals.
2. Reconciliation Service:
    - Handles the actual synchronization requests sent to individual devices.
    - Ensures each device's state is updated to match the desired state.
    - Operates using the existing hardware control infrastructure, ensuring
      compatibility and reducing overhead.

### Input Data:

- The desired state of the hardware, which is updated each time a user executes
  a command.
- The current state of the hardware, which is periodically checked against the
  desired state by the reconciliation service.

### Outputs:

- None: As a background task, this feature does not produce direct outputs.
  Instead, it operates silently, ensuring the hardware remains synchronized
  without user intervention.

## Implementation

### Core Methods:

1. Start Function:

    - Initiates the reconciliation process.
    - Enables the background task that periodically checks and syncs the
      hardware state.
    - Exposed to users via an API and a UI button.

2. Stop Function:

    - Disables the reconciliation process.
    - Stops the background task, preventing further sync operations.
    - Also exposed via an API and a UI button.

### Dependencies:

- This feature leverages the existing hardware control infrastructure for
  executing sync commands.
- No external libraries are required, ensuring minimal additional overhead.

## Usage

### User Interaction:

- API Usage:
    - Users can start or stop the hardware reconciliation process via provided
      API endpoints.
- UI Interaction:
    - Users can enable or disable the feature through UI buttons, providing a
      simple and intuitive way to control the reconciliation process.

### Configuration Parameters:

- Interval: Determines how frequently the background task runs.
- Task Status: Indicates whether the reconciliation task is currently active or
  inactive.
  These parameters are configurable through the bridge component, allowing users
  to customize the reconciliation process according to their needs.

## Examples

### Starting the Reconciliation Process:

```http request
POST http://localhost:3334/api/v1/
```

### Stopping the Reconciliation Process:

```http request
POST http://localhost:3334/api/v1/
```

### UI Interaction:

- Start Button: Clicking this button in the UI will enable the reconciliation
  feature.
- Stop Button: Clicking this button in the UI will disable the reconciliation
  feature.

## Error Handling

### Error Logging:

- Any errors encountered during the reconciliation process are logged to the
  error logs of the bridge component.
- These errors are not surfaced to the user directly due to the background
  nature of the task, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Common Errors:

- Command Execution Failure: Logged when a sync command fails to execute on a
  device.
- Timeout Issues: Logged if the sync commands take longer than expected,
  potentially indicating the need for a longer interval.

## Performance Considerations

### Interval Configuration:

- Key Limitation: The interval for the background task must be set large enough
  to allow all sync commands to complete before the task is run again. If the
  interval is too short, subsequent commands might be missed, leading to partial
  synchronization.
- Recommendation: Monitor the duration of sync commands and adjust the interval
  accordingly to prevent bottlenecks.

## Future Enhancements

- Dynamic Interval Adjustment: Implement a feature that dynamically adjusts the
  interval based on the current system load and command execution times.
- User Notification: Consider adding a mechanism to notify users if persistent
  errors occur during reconciliation, while still maintaining the background
  task nature.
